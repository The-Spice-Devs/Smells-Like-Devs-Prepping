# Group Project: Team Agreement

The first step in project planning is establishing a Team Agreement. This will be used as the guideline for how your team will collaborate during project week.

Projects are stressful, and can ignite emotions that otherwise wouldn’t be a problem. It’s important that the safety and security of the group comes first, and that an agreement is in place to establish expectations and accountability among the whole group.

## Planning

Schedule a 1-hour meeting for your entire project team.

Use this time to review the Team Agreement requirements below, and establish consensus on how to handle each requirement.

## Deliverable

Start a public-facing GitHub markdown file, and include the following components in your team agreement submission.

### Cooperation Plan

Every person on your team is an asset. This is your chance to discover the hidden strengths and areas for growth for each team member.

Describe at least:

-   What are the key strengths of each person on the team?
	- Thomas: Deployment, Postgres, Calmness
	- Ella: Backend stuff, TailwindCSS, Awesomeness
	- Dwight: Backend Stuff, Kindness and Devoteness (hardworker)
	- Mish: Cheerleader! Strong Mama Bear, CSS, Backend as well
	- Eden: Research, Organized, React/Front end
-   How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?
	- I think that we're a good mix of strengths and will be able to keep on track and work efficiently. Good for avoiding conflict. 
-   In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?
	- Thomas: Communication
	- Ella: Confidence
	- Dwight: Learning new stuff quickly
	- Mish: Overcoming Anxiety 
	- Eden: TDD, confidence 
-   Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?
	- Two group meetings, one at the beginning of the day and at the end of the day. 
	- Follow the fifteen minute rule and ask for help as needed. 
	- Work in pairs to balance each other off. Unless someone's feeling extra confident in one aspect (or maybe especially if someone's feeling extra confident). 

> **NOTE**: Undoing, Redoing, Replacing, or otherwise steamrolling the project as an individual is considered to be unacceptable. Account for the inevitable divergence of ideas, execution tasks, and assignments of duties here.

### Conflict Plan

Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.

Describe at least:

-   What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
	- Talk about it as the whole team and if we can't get to a resolution escalate to JB. 
	- Just be willing to listen, willing to compromise. 
	- If someone's feeling extra frustrated encourage them to take a break to step away before trying to resolve the issue.
-   What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
	- Sit down and chat with that person, ask *why* that person is taking control, also ask how other team members can pick up more work. 
	- This is a stressful time, so it's good to reassure the person that the team is here to help. 
-   How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
	- More stand ups to get on the same page. 
	- This project is a great opportunity for all of us to mentor and help each other and show our individual strengths. 
	- Follow the 15 minute rule.
-   How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
	- Keep an eye on the contributions and pass the screen off to each other. 
	- If someone isn't contributing just having open communication and ask what's goin on, it's likely that person feels like they can't contribute and it's our responsibility as a team to build each other up. 
-   How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
	- If group can't comt to an agreement, we'll call in a third party mediator (JB or maybe a TA) to help us get to the bottom of the conflict.

### Communication Plan

Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.

Describe at least:

-   What hours will you be available to communicate?
	- Thomas: 9-6
	- Ella: 9-6
	- Dwight: 9-6
	- Mish: 9-6
	- Eden: 9-6 (later if needed but not preferred)
-   What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
	- Slack 
	- Remo/Zoom if needed
-   How often will you take breaks?
	- As needed (try for 10min/hr) 
	- lunch 1hr (noonish)
-   What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
	- Longer nights
	- Scale back MVP (keep checking in about MVP and making sure we're close)
		- as lean as possible MVP definition up front
-   How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
	- Slack as needed (respectfully)
-   What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?
	- Everyone gets at least 3 minutes to talk during standup (uninterupted)
-   How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
	- Referencing back to those 3 minutes, if you need longer to talk that's okay
	- Don't interupt people when they are speaking, and listening fullheartedly when they are speaking
	- if someone is being especially quiet, encourage them to talk  
	- At beginning of morning stands-ups, each team member shares one personal, non-coding related thing about what's going on in their lives at the moment, recognizing this fosters greater understanding and sensitivity for one another.

### Work Plan

Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.

> **NOTE**: While researching and experimentation is always encouraged, writing and/or committing code to the project on your own during non-working hours or over the weekend is never acceptable. This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks.

Describe at least:

-   How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?
	- Jira - sprints that have to-do lists allowing you to add specific people to the task. 
	- Also has "Epics" which we can use for the user stories
-   What project management tool will be used?
	- Jira

### Presentation Deck

Make a single copy of the [Presentation Deck Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NeXKKEpjK2DDme8EwlZBsJndUqIgGYzWrY6FAYtNTf0/edit#slide=id.g2accd1c413_3_31). Share your copy will all team members, so everyone is working from the same file.

[Link to the shared doc in your project plan.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WwcZhFPevnMV2WWOjw9IiGGKH4uPVIp1rnqhOzyoCNI/edit?usp=sharing)

### Schedule your practice session

Work with your instructor to pre-schedule an date and time for your “practice run” of your presentation. This should either be an exact time, or a short window of time designated by your instructor. Plan for a 30-45 minute meeting during the class session before your actual presentation to allow time for both your practice run and feedback from the instructional team.

Reminder as you work on and practice your presentations:

-   Expressions of gratitude should be heartfelt.
-   When not presenting, team members should make strong eye contact with the “audience” / camera.
-   Be positive, no matter how tired or burned out you may feel … “Your smiles can be heard over the phone”

### Git Process

Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for coding tasks.

Describe at least:

-   What components of your project will live on GitHub?
	- Front end code/tests
		- Link to deployed Site
	- Back end code/tests
		- Link to deployed API
	- Project Preps
	- Wireframes
	- Software requirements
-   How will you share the repository with your teammates?
	- We're going to make an organization
-   What is your Git flow?
	- Definitely at least during both stand ups(morning/end of day)
	- as completion of a feature
	- maybe after lunch
	- as needed AD HOC 
	- Request: No branch protection until we get hello world deployed. Then set up branch protection
-   Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:
    -   How many people must review a PR?
	    - 2
    -   Who merges PRs?
	    - As a team (someone other than the two but with team approval)
    -   How often will you merge?
	    - Add hawk :) 
    -   How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?
	    - During standups/ad hoc as a team 

## Submitting Your Work

This is a group submission. Only one person must submit for group credit.

Please have everyone’s name at the top of the doc.

Submit a link to your the GitHub markdown file where you have created your Team Agreement.

This step must be completed and approved before proceeding with any project work. Notify your instructor when this is ready for review.
